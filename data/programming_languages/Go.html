<p>Go â€“ a statically typed compiled language designed at Google in 2007 by Ken Thompson (the inventor of C). 
    It is syntactically similar to C, but with memory safety and garbage collection. Go was released in 2012 as open source software. 
    Today, it\'s a popular choice for high-performance server-side application.</p>
<p>Go\'s syntax includes changes from C aimed at keeping code concise and readable. 
    For example, Go provides type inference mechanism that allows the programmer to write i := 3 instead of var I int = 3 with combined declaration/initialization operator (:=). 
Semicolons still terminate statements; but are implicit when the end of a line occurs. Methods may return multiple values.</p>
<h4>Types</h4>
<p>Go has a number of built-in types, including numeric ones (byte, int64, float32, etc.), booleans, and character strings (string). 
    Strings are immutable. Custom types can be defined with the struct keyword. Pointers are available for all types.</p>
