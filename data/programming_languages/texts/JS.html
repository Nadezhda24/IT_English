<p>JavaScript a high level single threaded garbage collected interpreted or just-in-time compiled prototype-based multi-paradigm dynamic language. 
It was created in 1995 in just one week by Brendan Ike. The main purpose of creating this language was adding an easy to learn scripting language to the Netscape browser. 
The first name of JavaScript was LiveScript but in two month it was renamed to JavaScript (to sound like popular Java).</p>
	
<p>Today it\'s a fully featured language that standardized by the ECMAScript standard. It\'s most well known for building front-end web applications 
because it is the only language other than web assembly that is natively supported in browsers.</p>
	
<p>But with JavaScript you make whatever you want: server-side applications with Node.JS, mobile applications with React Native or Ionic and desktop applications with Electron. 
Also Unity has partial support of JavaScript.</p>
	
<p>JavaScript is a interpreted language, but the most popular JavaScript engines like V8 and Chromium use a just-in-time compiler to convert it to machine code at runtime. 
It\'s also excellent at handling input-output intensive jobs despite the fact that it\'s a single threaded language. 
It\'s possible due to non-blocking event loop that can queue up work in the background without blocking the main thread. 
This feature often used to make low-cost and high performance server applications with Node.JS.</p>
