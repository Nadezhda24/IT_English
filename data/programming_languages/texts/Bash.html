    Bash - is a command language interpreter for interacting with a computer from the command line.
    It's also called a shell, because it's surrounds the operating system kernel to hide it's details.
    Bash can help you to access data or writing files by typing simple commands in command line.

    First shell was developed in 1979 by Stephen Bourne and it's called <b>Bourne Shell</b>.
    It's was the most popular version of shell until 1989 when <i>the <b>B</b>ourne <b>A</b>gain <b>Sh</b>ell</i> (Bourne again sounds like <i>Born again</i>) or <b>Bash</b> was released.

    Today when you open up the terminal of the UNIX computer the default shell is usually Bash (thats why people think that Bash and Shell are the same things).
    But Bash is also a programming language that allows you to write scripts. It's means anything we type manually into the command line can be automated with bash code.

<h4>Tips</h4>
<p>Bash doesn't have familiar to us logical operators. Instead of it provides commands like <i>-lt</i> for <i>\<</i> operator (lt - lower than) etc.</p>
