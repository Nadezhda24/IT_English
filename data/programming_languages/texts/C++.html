<h3>Creators</h3>
<p>
    The C++ language was developed by Danish computer scientist <b>Bjarne Stroustrup</b>.
    Today C++ has a working group which continues to add new functionality and maintain the language.
</p>

<h3>Date of the first release</h3>
<p>
    The C++ first release was in 1985. In those days C++ has another name - <b>C with Classes</b>. 
    Despite of this C++ was standartised only in 1998. 
    After that the versions of C++ get the following names: C++03, C++11, ... C++20. 
    The last two digits are the last digits of the year in which a version has been introduced.

<h3>Brief description</h3>
<p>C++ can be pronunced like "si: plʌs plʌs"</p>
<p>
    C++ is a general purpose programming language and widely used now a days for <b>competitive programming</b>. 
    It has imperative, object-oriented and generic programming features. C++ is runs on lots of platform like Windows, Linux, Unix, Mac etc.
    C++ is intended for high-loaded systems creation because this is almost the only programming language which gives a programmer the full power of
    system control:
</p>
<ol>
    <li>Manual memory control</li>
    <li>Bitwise operations</li>
    <li>Low-level programming constructions</li>
    <li>Extensive multithreading toolkit</li>
</ol>
<p>
    One will say that C++ is almost <b>dead programming language</b> because it was created in 1985. This is completely wrong idea.
    A new C++ version releases every 3 years. Every time it brings a lot of new features to the wide programming community. It's fantastically
    if you know that initially it was a small extention above <b>C programming language</b>.
</p>
<p>
    A lot of IT-companies uses it in their systems. At the end of this article you will see how many popular programs were written via C++.
</p>

<h3>Purposes</h3>
<p>
    As I have already mentioned C++ is a general-purpose programming language. It means that programmer can create almost every program 
    via C++. But initially C++ was designed with an orientation toward <b>systems programming</b> and <b>embedded</b>, 
    <b>resource-constrained software</b> and <b>large systems</b>, with performance, efficiency, and flexibility of use. 
    
    Certainly C++ has also been found useful in many other contexts including:
</p>
<ol>
    <li>Desktop applications</li>
    <li>Video games</li>
    <li>E-commerce servers</li>
    <li>Databases</li>
    <li>Performance critical applications</li>
</ol>


<h3>Products written with *programming language name*</h3>
<p>
    Almost every complex system is written in C++ because of it performance orientation. Here is 
    a breif list of pupular programs which has been written via C++:
</p>
<ol>
    <li>Operating systems Windows and Unix</li>
    <li>Google Chrome web browser</li>
    <li>Microsoft office package</li>
    <li>World of Warcraft</li> 
    <li>Skype</li>
    <li>Virtual box</li>
    <li>Adobe Photoshop</li>
</ol>
