    Dart - a static type general purpose programming language, desingned for building 
    fast applications on multiple platforms. Often, Dart is called "mix of JS and Java".
</p>
<p>
    It was developed by Google in 2011 and was intended to be an alternative to JavaScript 
    by running apps in the browser. But it never embraced by web development community, so 
    Dart quickly found its purpose after Flutter was developed.

<h3>Flutter</h3>
<p>
    We cant talk about Dart without Flutter and vice versa. Flutter is a UI framework for building
    application on IOS, Android, web, desktop with the same code base. So instead of having different 
    programmers teams for building the same app to different platforms, you can have only one.
    Also Flutter has open repository for user-made components you can use in your project.
