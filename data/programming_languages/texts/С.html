<h3>Preface<h3> 
Not to be confused with C++

<h3>Description</h3>
<p>
C ([si:] - is pronounced like the letter c) - is a general-purpose, procedural programming language. It has been developed by <i>Dennis Ritchie</i> between 1972 and 1973 at <i>Bell Labs</i> (american company). Basically it was used for creating Unix utility-tools (Internally, Unix fully written in C, with the rarely exception of kernle, maybe).

It supports structure programming, recursion and variable scopes. By design this language has <b>static type system</b> which means that compiler have to know a type of every using variable at compile-time.

<p>
Professionals say that C is a father of almost every modern programming languages. It's customary to say that some languages are c-style. It means that syntax of some language is very familiar with syntax of C programming language. For instance, C-style languages are: <i>C++</i>, <i>C#</i>, <i>Java</i> (more  precisely is came from C++), <i>Rust</i>, <i>Ruby</i>, <i>Python</i>, <i>Perl</i>, <i>PHP</i> and several more.
</p>

<p>
For this reason C language became an academic language - it's used in teaching of young developers at universities and even at some schools.

<h3>Use of C programming language in our modern world</h3>
<p>
Despite of it's age C is widely used in modern world. The newer version of this language is called <b>C17</b> (version of 2018 year). Foremost this language is used in <b>microcontroller</b> programming. This is due to the fact that C has low-level instruments for: manual memory management (it increases speed of program), bitwise operations, which are basic interface for working with I/O pins of microcontroller.
