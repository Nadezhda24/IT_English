<p>In 2021 we have seen the rise of low code and no code platforms. These are platforms that allow you to develop apps, programs, and automated workflows. 
But, importantly, they require little to no coding/programming knowledge to use effectively.</p>

<p>For programmers, this does not mean the death of the profession â€” far from it, in fact. 
The increasing popularity of low code and no code simply means a shift in what programmers write and how they write it.</p>

<p>For trained programmers, low or no code platforms enable rapid deployment of dev builds. And for novices, they ease access into the world of development.</p>

<p>So, rather than writing programs completely, trained programmers will use low and no code platforms to release work quickly and smoothly. 
    Plus, they'll often work within these systems to create and maintain the code needed for them to function.</p>
