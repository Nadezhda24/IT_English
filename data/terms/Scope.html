<h3>Description</h3>
<p>Scope is a range withing a program for which an item is valid. 
By <b>item</b> we usually mean <b>variables</b>.
</p>

<p>
    Analogue of <b>scope</b> in Russian: <b>область видимости</b></p>. 
</p>

<h3>Kinds of scopes</h3>
<p>We distinguish two types of scopes:
<ol>
    <li>
        Global scope. Variables defined outside functions, classes and structures live in <b>global scope</b> and called <b>global variables</b>
    </li>
    <li>
        Local scope. Variables defined in functions live in <b>local scope</b>, allocated on <b>stack</b> and called <b>local variables</b>.
    </li>
</ol>
Usually <b>global variables</b> live during the entire program. On the opposite side <b>local variables</b> live only inside the pair of curly brackets where 
it's defined. When a <b>local variable</b> goes out of scope its value will be dropped.
</p>

<h3>What is a scope in programming languages?</h3>

<p>In almost every programming language <i>scope</i> is denoted by the pair of <b>curly brackets {}</b>.</p>
<p>Note: only in <i>Pascal</i> programming language scope is denoted by two <b>key words</b>: <i>begin</i> and <i>end</i></p>
