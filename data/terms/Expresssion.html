<h3>Definition</h3>
<p>
    In computer science, an expression is a syntactic construction that can be evaluated to it's value.
    More strictly, expression - is a combination of one or more <b>literals</b>, <b>constants</b>, <b>variables</b>,
    <b>functions</b> that programming language computes to a certain value.
</p>

<h3>Examples</h3>
<p>
    For instance, <b>3+8/4</b> - expression, because it can be computed to a result <b>5</b>. 
    Functions calls: <b>get_sum(3,5)</b> is also an expression - it returns a value <b>8</b>, of course if it have been defined properly.
</p>

<h3>Pitfalls</h3>
<p>
    Usually beginner programmers don't distinguish terms <b>expression</b> and <b>statement</b>. You should always remember, that expression is
    characterized by it's result value. Whereas statements in some programming langugages (for example, in <b>C</b>, <b>C++</b>> and <b>Rust</b>)
    always followed by a semicolon <i>;</i> - the sign of end of code line.
