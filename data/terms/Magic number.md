<p>
Magic numbers - number literals, usage of which in programs isn't obvious for everyone except the author of the program. By the way after several months it will be completely unclear even for him too.
</p>

<h3>How to avoid using of magic numbers?</h3>

<p>
Professionals strongly recommended to name every entity in your program. You should give a descriptive and meaningful name to each magic number: <b>array_length</b> instead of 10, <b>border_offset</b> instead of <i>53.2344</i> and so on.
</p>
	
<h3> Exceptions </h3>

<p>
Like in normal rules here are some exceptions. In programmers-bible - book <b>Complete code</b> authors advise to leave numbers <i>0</i> and <i>1</i> in form of <b>magic numbers</b>. These values are used frequently for initial value of variables (especially - counters) and indexes of loops.
