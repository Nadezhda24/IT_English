<h3>Definition</h3>
<p>
Boolean (<b>bool</b>) - is one of fundamental data types in programming, it represents a logical type. 
Usually in most programming languages it takes 1 byte, but theoretically it requires only 1 bit, because there're only 2 possible values: <b>true</b> or <b>false</b>.
</p>

<p>
Analogue of <b>boolean</b> in Russian: <b>булевский тип</b>, <b>логический тип</b></p>
</p>

<h3>Why is not this type called <b>logical</b>?</h3>

<p>
 We have a reasonable answer: the name of boolean type was given in honor of the English mathematician and logician <i>George Boole</i>. He is the first who used the logical types in one of his articles. 
</p>

<h3>Usage</h3>

<p>
Usually booleans are used for storing the results of computing of conditions. Moreover they can be used as flags in system programming, but most likely every experienced programmer will choose integers for this.
</p>

<h3>Exceptions</h3>
<p>
In some old versions of <b>C</b> language there isn't a bool type. Instead of it language implicitly treated every non-zero integers as true values and zeroes as false. Nevertheless C-maintainers added a library for boolean type in future versions.
