<h3>Definition</h3>
<p>
    Due to peculiarities of programming languages syntax you can't use <b>blank</b> symbols
    in names of: 
</p>
<ul>
    <li>Variables</li>
    <li>Functions</li>
    <li>Classes</li>
</ul>
<p>
    Instead of that you need to compound several words into one <b>identificator</b> 
    like so: <i>dontnamevariablesinthisway</i>. Have you noticed that this is hard to read? It's so, but what can we do?
</p>

<h3>Naming styles</h3>
<p>
    There're two popular(and possible) styles of naming everything in your code:
</p>
<ol>
    <li>Camel case. It was named after <i>camel's hump</i> - every new word have to
        begin with a capital letter. For example: <b>totalCustomerCounter</b></li>
    <li>Snake case. It was named after <i>snake body</i> - <b>underscores</b> are put 
        between every word pair. For instance: <b>query_string</b></li>
</ol>
<p>
    Usually software developers choose only one style and use it in all his projects for the sake bringing
    code into one style.
</p>

    Analogue of <b>camel case</b> in Russian: <b>верблюжий стиль</b>.
