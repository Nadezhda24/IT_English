<h3>Definition</h3>
<p>
    Escape sequences let us to embed characters in strings that cannot easily be
    typed on a keyboard. For instance, if you want to embed a <b>new line symbol</b> into
    some string in your code, you can't simply press <b>Enter button</b>, because it's
    incorrectly for programming languages to separate expressions by accidental new line 
    symbols. To do this properly, you have to use <b>special symbol</b>: "\\n" which
    refer to symbol with code 10 in <b>ASCII table</b>. 
</p>
<p>
    It worth noting that <b>escape sequences</b> work only with non-printable symbols:
    tabulations (<i>\\t</i>, табуляция), line feeds (<i>\\n</i>, перенос строки), 
    carriage return (<i>\\r</i>, возврат каретки),
    beep (<i>\\a</i>, звуковой сигнал).
</p>

<p>
    Analogue of <b>escape-sequence</b> in Russian: <b>управляющая последовательность</b>.
</p>

<h3>Representing Unicode symbols</h3>
<p>
    In some programming languages, in <b>Python</b> for instance, you can code string
    <b>Unicode literals</b> with help of escape sequences. To do this you need to 
    put "\\" symbol and the <b>hexadecimal code</b> of symbol. For example: "\xF578".
