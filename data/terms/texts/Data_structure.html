<h3>Definition</h3>
<p>
    A <b>data structure</b> is a particular way of organizing 
    data in a computer programs so that it can be used in 
    effective and convenient manner.
</p>

<p>
    Analogue of <b>data structure</b> in Russian: <b>структура данных</b>.
</p>
<p>
    Analogue of <b>collection</b> in Russian: <b>коллекция</b>
</p>

<p>
    Usually <b>data structures</b> supposed to create a <b>user-defined types</b> for
    representing real-world entities. Say we're developing a program for maintaining
    taxi car park. In such project we can create <i>entity</i> <b>car</b> and store in that
    <b>data structure</b> all related information: 
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        Manufacturer's brand
    </li>
    <li>
        Fuel tank volume
    </li>
    <li>
        Current mileage
    </li>
    <li>
        Number of seats
    </li>
</ul>

<p>
    To recup the above: programmers creates <b>data structures</b> that suit every their needs
    for every task. Nevertheless the shouldn't create every <b>data structure</b> from scratch.
    Fantastic amount of any available <b>data structure</b> was created during all time. So 
    programmer can just use the results of his colleages or <b>open-source</b> community.
    Besides every programming language standart library has the most appropriated implementation
    of widespread <b>data structures</b> for a particular tasks.
</p>

<p>
    Some <b>data structures</b> have another name: <b>collection</b>, they are
    used for storing a values in form of:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        Sequences. The most pervasive <b>sequences</b> in programming languages
        are <b>character sequences</b> or simply <b>strings</b>.
    </li>
    <li>
        Graphs - is a native approach for storing routes 
        (even whole road maps) or networks (computer networks, social networks).
        Every net is represented by two sets: set of vertexes(points) and set of edges(routes).
        Moreover graphs let programmer to develop sophisticated and comprehensive algorithms:
        finding possible ways(usually shortest or less expensive meaning costs)
    </li>
</ul>

<h3>Common data structures in programming languages</h3>
<ul>
    <li>
        Array (static length contiguous sequence of elements)
    </li>
    <li>
        Vector (dynamic length contiguous sequence of elements that can grow and shrink
        on demand)
    </li>
    <li>
        Linked list (double-linked list)
    </li>
    <li>
        Queue (/kjuː/ pronounces like letter <b>q</b>)
    </li>
    <li>
        Stack
    </li>
    <li>
        Binary tree (binary search tree, kind of <b>graph</b>)
    </li>
    <li>
        Heap
    </li>
    <li>
        Hashing
    </li>
    <li>
        Matrix (table of values)
    </li>
</ul>

<p>
    In conclusion we have to notice that <b>data types</b> are <b>data structures</b> too.
    Sometimes they are called <b>primitive data structures</b> because they only gives
    a meaning to <b>memory blob</b>.
