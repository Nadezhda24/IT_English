<h3>Definition</h3>
<p>
GUI (<b>G</b>raphic <b>U</b>ser <b>I</b>nterface, 
pronounced like <i>/dʒiːjuːˈaɪ/</i>, <i>gee-you-eye</i>) - is a technology
which allows users to interact with an application through graphical objects.
It its turn, program outputs results inside <b>windows</b> or <b>labels</b> -
textual marks inside <b>windows</b> of programs.
</p>

<p>
    Today <b>GUI</b> is a pervasive in programs, so it can be simply refered as 
    <b>user interface</b>. Moreover, it worth noting that every program you use today 
    (<i>except if you're a developer</i>) has GUI and actively use it.
</p>

<p>
    Analogue of <b>GUI</b> in Russian: <b>графический пользовательский интерфейс</b>.
    Be careful, there isn't a term <b>ГИП</b>.
</p>

<h3>History of GUI inventing</h3>
<p>
    The <b>graphical user interface</b>, developed in the late 1970s by the <b>Xerox 
    Palo Alto research laboratory</b> and deployed commercially in Apple's Macintosh and 
    Microsoft's Windows operating systems, was designed as a response to the problem of 
    inefficient usability in early, text-based command-line interfaces for the average user.

<h3>Developers pitfalls with GUI</h3>
<p>
    Despite it's usefulness for common users, it's fair to say that process of 
    GUI developing isn't as simple as it may seem. There're a couple of complexities:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        Every <b>operating system</b> provides their own <b>API</b>. It means that
        each <b>OS</b> let developers to use different non-standardized functions for
        creating programms' GUI. It's doesn't make sense if you develop programs only
        for one platform, for instance only for <b>Windows</b>. The problem is it's hard
        to make a <b>cross-platform programs</b> when there is no accepted standart.
    </li>
    <li>
        It's hard to create <b>scalable</b> GUI - such GUI which can be easily modifyed.
        There're many <b>design patterns</b> for it, the most widespread pattern is <b>MVC</b>,
        which stands for <b>M</b>odel <b>V</b>iew <b>C</b>ontrol. The main idea is to separate
        GUI logic (view) from programs data (model) and place an intermediate element for their communication (controller).
    </li>
</ul>
