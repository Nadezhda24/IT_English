<h3>Definition</h3>
<p>Compiler - is a program that translates the source code of some programming language into another one. Usually compiler converts a source code  into <b>machine code</b>.</p>

<p>
    Analogue of <b>compiler</b> in Russian: <b>компилятор</b></p>
</p>

<h3>Why do we need to use compilers?</h3>

<p>Computer isn't designed to understand high-level languages, which uses human-readable identificators and key words. CPU can recognize only the fixed set of operations each of which is encoded by binary number.</p>

<p>
Hence to force our machines to execute our programs we have to <b>translate</b> the high-level source code into machine code. 
</p>

<p>
Not every high-level language source code have to be compiled. There are to categories of languages: compiled and interpretable. So, only with compiled languages programmers have to use compilers as an intermediate tool to get their executables from source.
	
For instance, such languages as: <i>C</i>, <i>C++</i>, <i>Rust</i> are compiled.
