<h3>Definition</h3>
<p>
    In computer programming, a comment is a human-readable explanation 
    in the source code of a computer program. Developers adds comments with the purpose 
    of making the source code easier for humans to understand, and are generally ignored 
    by compilers and interpreters. 
</p>
<p>
    Comments are sometimes also processed in various ways to generate documentation 
    external to the source code itself by documentation generators, or used for 
    integration with source code management systems and other kinds of external 
    programming tools. For example every mature <b>IDE</b> maintains the <b>IntelliSense</b>
    technology which allows a programmer to get a documentation attached to a particular
    function (if it presented).

    Analogue of <b>comment</b> in Russian: <b>комментарий</b>.

<h3>Comment syntax</h3>
<p>
    The syntax of comments in various programming languages varies 
    considerably. Here is a brief list of what you may faced with:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        In C and C++ you can make a comment by printing <b>//</b> - single line comment or
        /**/ - multiline comment, which apparently can span multiple lines in a source code.
    </li>
    <li>
        In Assembler you can create a comment with help of semicolon symbol <b>;</b> 
        which is normally used to separate statements in compiled programming languages.
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    Some IDEs support so-called documenting comments which take the form of
    <b>///</b> or <b>/**</b>.
</p>

<h3>Pitfalls of using comments</h3>
<p>
    Newcomer programmers have two extremeness
</p>
<ul>
    <li>They don't write comments at all</li>
    <li>They try to comment every line and even obvious code</li>
</ul>
<p>
    Remember that you should use comments wisely, because they are intended for
    clarifying ambiguities.
</p>

<h3>Famous proverb and truthful </h3>
<p>
    Code never lies, comments sometimes do.
