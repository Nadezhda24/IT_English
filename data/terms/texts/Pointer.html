<h3>Definition</h3>
<p>
    A pointer is a variable that stores a memory address.
</p>

<p>
    Analogue of <b>pointer</b> in Russian: <b>указатель</b>.
</p>

<h3>Dynamic objects</h3>
<p>
    Usually pointers are used for storing an address of memory allocated for 
    dynamic object(s) which are created on a <b>Heap</b>. It's hard to predict carefully
    how much memory your program will consume, because this value depends on many other values
    such as program working duration, amount of input data and so on.
</p>
<p>
    As a result developers get an opportunity to allocate as much memory as needed. The problem
    is this memory has to be cleared manually in some languages (C and C++). This makes using
    <b>pointers</b> one of many advanced topics in programming.
</p>

<h3>Smart pointer</h3>
<p>
    Due to the previous difficulties developers invented so-called <b>smart pointers</b>.
    This is an implementation of <b>RAII(Resource Acquisition Is Initialization)</b> programming
    paradigm. As for pointers this principle means that pointer will be cleared 
    by it's owner object automatically after going out of <b>scope</b>.
</p>
<p>
    For instance, in C++ programming language smart pointer types are following:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>Unique pointer (unique_ptr). Fully owns the memory it is given and can't share it with
        other objects.
    </li>
    <li>Shared pointer (shared_ptr). Apparently allows sharing resources between other shared
        pointers.
    </li>
    <li>Weak pointer (weak_ptr)</li>
</ul>

<h3>Pointers in modern programming languages</h3>
<p>
    By virtue of complexity of using pointers in many modern programming languages
    developer have no possibility to use it. For example in Python there aren't any pointers
    in their pure meaning. Variables are already pointers and these terms are merged for 
    simplifying.
