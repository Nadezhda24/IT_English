<h3>Definition</h3>
<p>
    Generally, <b>slicing</b> is an operation that extracts a subset of elements 
    from a <i>sequence</i>.
</p>

<p>
    Analogue of <b>slice</b> in Russian: <b>срез</b>, <b>отрезок</b>.
</p>


<h3>Definition pitfalls</h3>
<p>
    The difficult is some <b>programming languages</b> defines <b>slice</b> in their own
    way. For instance, in <b>Rust programming language</b> <b>slice</b> is defined as a
    <b>reference</b> to a contiguous sequence of elements of a collection, i.e. here you
    can define a reference to a part of sequence rather than to a whole sequence.
</p>

<p>
    Whereas in <b>Python programming language</b> <b>slice</b> lets you to construct a 
    new <b>sequence</b> from the part of an existing one.
</p>

<h3>Syntax of slices in different languages</h3>
<p>
    In <b>Rust</b> you can create a <b>slice</b> in following way: 
    <i>&s[0..5]</i>, assuming that <b>s</b> is a string. This sentence takes 5 symbols -
    from 0th up to 4th positions.
</p>
<p>
    In <b>Python</b> you create references by typing <b>s[0:4]</b>, assuming that <b>s</b>
    is a sequence (list, tuple, string). This sentence takes 4 symbols from - 0 up to 3rd.
</p>

<h3>What languages let you to use slices?</h3>
<p>
    <b>Slice</b> should be considered as a <b>complex</b> construction. Not every programming
    language provides ability to get slices. For instance, <b>Rust</b> and <b>Python</b> - relatively
    new programming languages do, and such languages as <b>C</b> don's.
