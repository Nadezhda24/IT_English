<h3>Definition</h3>
<p>
    Socket - a program interface for sending and recieving data between two computers through the network.
</p>

<p>
    Analogue of <b>Network socket</b> in Russian: <b>Сокет</b>.
</p>

<h3>Server and client sockets</h3>
<p>
    There are 2 types of sockets:
    <ul>
        <li>
            Server sockets - a type of socket that waits for requests to come in over the network.
            When server socket gets a connection, it provide an instance of client socket that 
            bound with <i>remote endpoint (IP-address and port of connected client)</i>.
            After that, server can use this connection for its intended purpose.
        </li>
        <li>
            Client sockets - a type of socket that start a connection between client and server.
            Client socket use a ip-address and port of the remote host to establish a connection.
            After it has been done, programmer can use this interface to proceed data through it and waiting for the answer.
        </li>
    </ul>
</p>
<h3>Connection protocols</h3>
<p>
    There are two most common protocols of transmitting information through the network - UDP and TCP.<br>

    Sockets using UDP called <i>connectionless sockets</i> or <i>datagramm sockets</i> (because UDP - <b>U</b>ser <b>D</b>atagramm <b>P</b>rotocol).
    Datagramm sockets can't guarantee safety of transmitting information but they are very fast.<br>

    Sockets using TCP calles <i>connection-oriented sockets</i> or <i>stream sockets</i>.
    Stream sockets monitor the safety of transmitting information but it leads to an increase of network traffic. Also, TCP socket is slower than UDP one.
