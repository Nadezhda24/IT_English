table of cells. Each cell is a minimum  memory block. Usually ...

<h3>Types of memory in programming</h3>
<p>
    Generally there're two big types of memory in programming:
    <ol>
        <li>
            Stack
        </li>
        <li>
            Heap
        </li>
    </ol>
    Let's shed some light on every memory type.

<h3>Stack</h3>

</p>

<h3>Heap</h3>
<p>
    The main purpose of this memory section is managing <b>dynamic memory</b>. 
</p>
<p>
    Imagine following situation: you're a client database developer who wants his programs to consume
    the minimum amount of expensive computer memory. The client said that he don't exactly knows
    how much records have to be there. You can assume that there can't be more than 1000 clients at
    a given time. But what if limit will be exceeded? Well you can reserve a bit more memory for future
    needs. And a bit more memory again and again. At some moment your system will consume 
    inadmissible amount of memory. What will a good programmer do?

    To recap dynamic memory is a memory which program can request at runtime and it's size 
    can't be properly predicted in advance.
