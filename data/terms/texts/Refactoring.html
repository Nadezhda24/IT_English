<h3>Definition</h3>
<p>
    Refactoring - the process when a programmer tries to make a part of an
    existing code base a bit more tidy and obvious. Moreover, the process of 
    refactoring can be tied with another process - <b>optimization</b>.
</p>
<p>
    In other words, <b>refactoring</b> - is an attempt of <b>rewriting</b> an 
    existing code chunk to get more clear results.
</p>

<p>
    Analogue of <b>refactoring</b> in Russian: <b>рефакторинг</b>
</p>

<h3>Why should developers make a refactoring from time to time?</h3>
<p>
    There're some key points of why should we make our code bases cleaner:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>Usually there're programmers with different skills of writing code and
        understanding "what's going on". Entry-level engineers usually 
        unable to write a code of a good quality. After several month of high-load
        work on a project some parts of a code base may look like strange and 
        useless (but this it's only your feeling of it!).
    </li>
    <li>
        Everyday different programmers do changes on existing code. Their skills
        gradually increase during their career. At some moment they can consider 
        a previous code chunks as awful ones or even disgusting.
    </li>
    <li>
        Due to everyday code changes project becomes dirty and can't be 
        understood fully by one person (except the teamlead, maybe). Programmers
        have to control a complexity of the software they produce.
    </li>
    <li>
        Your elder teammates can improve some parts of your previous code for
        suiting team's <b>conventions</b> or <b>naming style</b>.
    </li>
</ul>

<h3>Some tips for making refactoring</h3>
<p>
    Keep changes atomic and small. Really, developer shouldn't try to change all
    at once. With a high probability such programmer will break even <b>perfectly</b>
    working parts of a software. 
</p>
<p>
    Always use CVS when you make a refactoring to avoid previous situation - you will 
    have an opportunity to revert changes back.
