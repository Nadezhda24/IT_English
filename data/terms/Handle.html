<h3>Definition</h3>
<p>
    In computer programming, a <b>handle</b> is an abstract reference to a resource 
    that is used when application software references <b>blocks of memory</b> or 
    <b>objects</b> that are managed by another system like a <b>database</b> or 
    an <b>operating system</b>.
</p>

<p>
    Analogue of <b>handle</b> in Russian: <b>дескриптор</b></p>
</p>

<h3>What is a handle internally?</h3>
<p>
    In many systems <b>handles</b> are just <b>integers</b>. They have no meaning outside of the system
    that created it. Hence only a parent-system knows what each <b>handle</b> points to.
</p>

<h3>Where can you face with handles?</h3>

<p>
    At the time of writing this article the most popular and widespread operating system is <i>Windows</i>.
    Windows has it's own <b>API(Application programming interface</b> - the set of functions that can be used by programmers
    in building their <i>Windows-programs</i>.
</p>
<p>
    For instance, when a programmer create a window (rectangle area of screen that can receive
    user input and can output graphic information) using Windows API he invokes a functions
    <b>CreateWindow</b>. That function returns a <b>handle</b> to a Window - a specific reference
    to a particular resource in <b>operating system</b>, in this case - a reference to created window.
</p>
<p>
    Let's investigate another example. Imagine that you develop a network application for Linux - 
    your own <i>Telegram</i>. To make a connection between host and a client of your service you have to use
    <b>sockets</b> - it's an abstraction of a data-transfer connection between two programs. Insofar as a <b>socket</b>
    is a resource of the <b>operating system</b> we can refer a particular <b>socket</b> using it's <b>handle</b>
