<h3>Classification of programming languages</h3>
<p>
In programming world there\'re many different classification of what we call "programming languages". 
</p>

<p>
One of that classification is following - there\'re two types of programming languages: low-level and high-level.
</p>

<h3>Low-level languages</h3>
<p>
Let\'s begin with low-level languages. They are designed to be convenient for system programmers who tends to create a high-performance programs, which can use almost every hardware feature of using machine. For example, such languages are used for creating *operating systems (OS)*. In particular - the most popular languages for creating OS are C and C++. 
</p>

<p>
Besides at the moment of creation this article another popular language lays up claim on creation of OS: Rust. We will see in the near future what will happen with it. ;)
</p>
	
<p>
To recognize a low-level language you should notice this syntax and set of available operations. In low-level languages *small operations* are widely used: bitwise operations, manual dynamic memory arrangement, pointers, ability to store data explicitly in registers of machine and so on. All these features increase the execution speed of program what is critical for such purposes.
</p>

<h5>Note</h5>
<p>The most famous low-level language - Assembler.</p>

<h3>High-level languages</h3>

<p>
It\'s quiet simple to find out that a language is high-level - it\'s "programmer friendly", which means, that a programmer can do little effort and get a huge results. Almost every high-level language is full of different abstractions: data streams, garbage collectors, inheritance, polymorphism, encapsulation. 
</p>

<p>
Moreover high-level languages are designed for creating business application and usually have tools for supporting cross-platform developing.
</p>

<p>
	There\'re a huge number of high-level languages: <i>Python</i>, <i>Java</i>, <i>Rust</i>, <i>C++</i> (it also has a low-level instruments), <i>Pascal</i>, <i>Lua</i> and so on.
