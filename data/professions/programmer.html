<h3>Definition</h3>
<p>
    <i>Programmer</i>(sometimes called a <b>software developer</b>, <b>software engineer</b> or even <b>coder</b>) is a person 
    who creates computer software. 
    More precisely <b>software engineer</b> is a specialist in several areas of <b>computer science</b>.
</p>

<p>Analogue of <b>programmer</b> in Russian: <b>программист</b>, <b>разработчик программного обеспечения</b></p>

<h3>Programmer's level</h3>
<p>
    In real vacancies programmers are divided into several positions:
    <ul>
        <li>
            Junior software developer. This is a name of entry-level programmers who need to be guided by their elder teammates in many 
            technical questions.
        </li>
        <li>
            Middle software developer. This is a name of intermediate experienced programmers who can perform medium-sized tasks alone.
        </li>
        <li>
            Senior software developer. This is a name of software developers with many years of experience in solving business problems with programs.
        </li>
        <li>
            Team-lead software developer. Usually in componies programmers don't work alone because it's hard to write entire program by oneself. 
            Instead of this programmers work in teams. There is a leader of that group - <b>team-lead</b>. He is in charge of dividing of tasks between
            participants of team and of new-hire programs.
        </li>
    </ul>

    It's obvious that programmers salary depends on his level and experience.

<h3>History</h3>
<p>
    British countess and mathematician <i>Ada Lovelace</i> is often considered to be the first computer programmer, 
    as she was the first to publish part of a program (<b>specifically an algorithm</b>) intended for implementation on Charles Babbage's 
    analytical engine in <i>1842</i>. The algorithm was used to calculate Bernoulli numbers. Because Babbage's machine was never 
    completed as a functioning standard in Lovelace's time, she never had the opportunity to see the algorithm in action.
</p>
<p>
    Later in <i>1979</i> <b>Ada programming language</b> was created and named after the first programmer - <b>Ada Lovelace</b>.
